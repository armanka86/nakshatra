nakshatra
==========

Nakshatra is a variant chess engine originally built to play [suicide chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Losing_Chess) on [FICS](http://www.freechess.org). It can technically play normal chess as well but little to no effort has been made to improve its normal chess playing strength. One of my initial goals was to support many [chess variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_variants) so I believe the code is well organized for that purpose, at least, though I never actually got around to adding more variants :)

Once upon a time, I (sparingly) maintained a companion [blog](http://nakshatrachess.blogspot.com).

NOTE: As of late 2016, suicide chess is weakly solved. White can force a [win with 1. e3](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~watkins/LOSING_CHESS/ICGA2016.pdf).
